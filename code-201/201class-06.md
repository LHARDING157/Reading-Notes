# Read: Class 06 - Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?  
A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?  
convenience, flexibility in declaration, and less code during declaration.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?  
Objects is a special data type that can store a collection of data. Arrays are a special type of variable that can store a list of values.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.  
If it is a dynamic key.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term 'this' refer to and what is the advantage to using 'this'?  

> const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}

“This” keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code. Advantages of using it are to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name.

1. What is the DOM?  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.  
They can both manipulate the document.
